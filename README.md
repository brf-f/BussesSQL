# BussesSQL
Python and SQL Bus ticketing system

This program is written fully in python and sqlite3


Users should be able to buy tickets and view available busses to buy tickets from.
There is also an admin menu for viewing all income as well as reseting the table, changing routes (Editing values, adding routes, deleting routes), and closing the program.

The program is protected from invalid input errors and sql injections as all inputs are checked before being used.
